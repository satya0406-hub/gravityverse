### 🔒 Operational Notice on API Key Security & Automatic Revocation:
If you recently paste or write an API key directly into your program files and push it to a public GitHub repository (or share it in a public log), **GitHub's push-protection scanning and Google's Security Scanner will instantly detect and permanently disable/revoke the key within seconds for your protection.** This is why hardcoding keys directly in program files and pushing them to git causes them to stop working immediately.

### 🚀 Recommended Method to Securely Connect Your Bot on GitHub Pages:
You **never** need to write or share your API key in the program code! You can keep your key completely private and safe:

1. **Configure as a Secret in GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository on GitHub.com.
   - Click **Settings** (gear icon at the top menu of the repository page).
   - In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Click the **New repository secret** button.
   - Name the secret exactly: \`GEMINI_API_KEY\`
   - Paste your official **Gemini API Key** (starts with \`AIzaSy...\`) as the value and click **Add secret**.

2. **How it Works**:
   - The compiled build workflow file (\`.github/workflows/build.yml\`) automatically grabs your hidden GitHub Secret at compile-time and injects it safely into the built static files.
   - This keeps your key completely private, avoids any automated security revocation, and enables the chatbot to work instantly on your active link!

Once a valid Gemini API key is configured securely via your GitHub secrets or local hosting environments, the chatbot will automatically activate to answer all topics with Google's high-speed **gemini-3.5-flash**!`;
